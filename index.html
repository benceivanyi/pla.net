    <h1>Looking in a mirror</h1>
    <p>Looking at photographs of the Earth is analogous to looking in a mirror. You see yourself, your environment. The planet is more abstract though. It’s probably impossible to conceptually grasp all the details it encompasses, the topography, landscapes, species, people, urban environments. It’s also wild to consider the first images of Earth from space only emerged roughly 60 years ago, around 1965, which was followed by 1972’s <span class="p-italic">The Blue Marble</span>. The photo, taken by the Apollo 17 crew, became one of the most reproduced images in history.</p>

    <h1>The first Earth day</h1>
    <p>The semiotic presence of the “planet” or “Earth” symbol became an increasingly adopted phenomenon. As economic and cultural globalisation started to appear on the horizon, so did this symbol on the cultural landscape. The universal recycling symbol, originating on the first Earth Day in 1970, was a key marker of this cultural shift. Its circular shape, ecological associations, and “release date" echoes these themes.</p>

    <h1>Kids in cyberspace</h1>
    <p>Fast forward to 1995, the global market established its cultural hegemony: we became more and more connected. Released around this time, in 1995 to be precise, Internet Explorer became the hallmark playground-software for many 2000s kids with a Windows XP PC, alongside Google Earth. The logo itself carried much of the “world wide” qualities of the web.</p>

    <h1>The most replicated Earth graphic</h1>
    <p>Fast forward another 20 years, perhaps the most ubiquitous replications of the globe, the planet emoji. Released in iOS 10.2 on 12 December, 2016, the image have been countless Twitter users’ PFPs, and is used in online communications that denote a “global view” that is now at the forefront of our creative processes.</p>

    <h1>Project your new world view</h1>
    <p>Olafur Eliasson’s 2020 Earth perspectives took over the world next, landing on the <span class="p-italic">TIME</span> magazine cover. ‘Eliasson has created a series of nine images of the Earth, each of which has been abstracted by turning the planet on a different axis. Each image also denotes a particular spot on Earth with a “dot”. If a viewer stares at the dot for about ten seconds and then trains their focus onto a blank surface, an afterimage appears in the complementary colours of Eliasson’s visual – the viewer literally projects a new world view.’</p>

<h1>On my home screen</h1>
    <p>The next hit in the planet semiotic saga comes once again from Apple, in the form of the dynamic astronomy wallpaper, released in iOS 16 on 6 June, 2022. Architect and Real Review Editor-in-Chief Jack Self writes on the astronomy wallpaper: ‘At every time of the day or night I see an image of our planet and it’s weather, mapped from a geostationary orbit where I am the centre.’ Perhaps this is the first time the globe iconography became localised, in an explicit way. It always points to you on your screen, the centre of the world. To shake the barriers of our perceptions, it would’ve been infinitely more fascinating if it showed a completely different part of the world, or even the habitats of different species. Once again, looking at the Earth is analogous to looking in a mirror. You see yourself.</p>
